### Prerequisites:
1. Python Programming language
2. MySql
3. flask
4. flask_restful
5. Docker (Optional)

### Technologies Used:

In the project I have used the below technologies:
1. flask - Utilized flask to create a dynamic and robust web application in my project.
2. flask_restful - Implemented flask_restful to enhance functionality and create RESTful APIs
3. flask_sqlalchemy - Used Flask_sqlalchemy to effectively interact with databases(ORM)
4. HTML - Employed HTML to structure and create well-formed web pages.
5. CSS - Incorporated CSS to provide a polished and visually appealing user interface in my project.

```
Note:
Python is the main programming language used in the flask and flask_restful and flask_sqlalchemy and
flask_sqlalchemy and is the foundation for the project.
```

### API DESIGN:
The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for both user and blogpost entities have been 
implemented and documented in the OpenAPI specification, utilizing the YAML format. The file containing the 
API definition is named "blogpost.yaml" for easy reference and management.
